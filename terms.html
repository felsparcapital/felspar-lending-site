              <p>
                The information on this Site is provided for general informational purposes only and does not constitute
                financial, legal, or investment advice. Accessing or submitting information through this Site does not
                create any lender–borrower, client, fiduciary, or investment-advisor relationship between you and Felspar
                Lending or Felspar Capital.

              <h2>Business-Purpose Loans Only</h2>
              <p>
                All loans originated, arranged, or funded by Felspar Lending are strictly for business or investment
                purposes and may not be used for personal, family, or household purposes. Felspar Lending does not
                originate or arrange owner-occupied residential mortgages or consumer credit transactions. All loans are
                exempt from the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act
                (RESPA). Borrowers must represent and warrant that each loan is for business, commercial, or investment
                purposes and that no property securing a loan will be owner-occupied.

                defined under Rule 501(a) of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933. Any offering of securities will be
                made only through definitive offering documents delivered to verified accredited investors and will rely on
                Rule 506(c) of Regulation D. Nothing on this Site constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
                buy any security in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Past performance is
                not indicative of future results, and no guarantee of any return or repayment is expressed or implied.

                Lending reserves the right to modify or withdraw loan programs at any time.
